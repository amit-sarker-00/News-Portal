          <h3>Question-1: Difference between var,let and const</h3>
          <strong>
            <p>
              var : The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in
              JavaScript. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function
              scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be
              accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular
              function can be accessed within the function.
            </p>
            <p>
              let: The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.
              The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can’t be
              accessible outside the particular block ({block}).
            </p>
            <p>
              const: The const keyword has all the properties that are the same
              as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.When users
              declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise,
              it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable
              once it is declared.

            Question-2: Difference between arrow function and regular function
          </h3>
          <strong>
            <p>
              1. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own
              this.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are
              available in regular functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Regular functions created using function declarations or
              expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’. Since regular
              functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’
              keyword. However, the arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not
              constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying to
              construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new
              keyword.

          <h3>Question-3: Difference between map,forEach,filter and find</h3>
          <strong>
            <p>
              map : .map() executes the same code on every element in an array
              and returns a new array with the updated elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              forEach : .forEach(),is used to execute the same code on every
              element in an array but does not change the array and it returns
              undefined.
            </p>
            <p>
              filter : .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it
              meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements
              that return truthy for the criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              find : The find() method returns the first element in the provided
              array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values
              satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

          <h3>Question-4: Why you use template string?</h3>
          <strong>
            <p>
              template string : Template strings are a powerful feature of
              modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
              variables and expressions into strings without needing to
              concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to
              create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
